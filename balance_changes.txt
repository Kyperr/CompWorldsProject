ZER too fast. closes distance without enough player react time. 



HYD fine. need to check in conjunction with other enemies.



ULT slow down shots per second. despawn bullets before new bullets spawn



MUT fine just don't have too many at once. maybe reduce view distance so they actually move? they never rotate to face player when shooting.
